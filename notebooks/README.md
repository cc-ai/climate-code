# Notebooks

* `stats`: descriptive statistics about the whole CANOPEX dataset.
* `canopex-monthly-arima.ipynb`: creates various ARIMA models for discharge in the CANOPEX dataset (one river).
* `canopex-precip.ipynb`: (draft) attempts to analyse precipitation from the CANOPEX dataset for one river.
* `canopex-decomposition.ipynb`: decomposes the discharge time series into trend, seasonality, and residual. Trains an ARIMA model to learn the residual.
* `canopex-analysis.ipynb`: checks CANOPEX dataset from NaNs and stationarity.
* `resample-data`: resample data from the old datset (one hydrological stations taking a monthly average and analyse it.
* `arima-monthly.ipynb`: (draft) trains ARIMA on a station from the old dataset.
* `arima-3.ipynb`: trains auto-ARIMA on a station from the old dataset (best performance).
